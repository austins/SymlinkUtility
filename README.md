Symlink Utility
==============

This program lets the user create NTFS symbolic links through a simple graphical user interface.

A symbolic link is a special type of file that contains a reference to another file or folder.

A symbolic link is similar to a shortcut, but it behaves like a real file or folder with its own absolute paths.
